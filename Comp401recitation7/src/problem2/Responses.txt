1.) What makes you say your code isn't working?
the constructor does not work because it is assigning a a variable to itself
remove star never actually removes a star

            
2.) What did you expect your code to do and why?
I expected the code to return correct values for the star map

3.) What did your code do instead and why?
instead it threw the out of bounds "error" from the above code for each part because it did not equal one
