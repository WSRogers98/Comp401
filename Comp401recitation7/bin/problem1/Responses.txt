1.) What makes you say your code isn't working?
Students who do not meet the course requirements are listed in the roster

2.) What did you expect your code to do and why?
I expected it to print out just the names of those with the 
requirements because the get roster should only 
accept them
3.) What did your code do instead and why?
the code put everyone in the roster because there is no way to filter the students
